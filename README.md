Hello,

I have already added two to-do tasks in Home and Office bucket.

Steps:
1. Add new bucket if you wish.
2. Select bucket and add task and click add new task. You will get the task in bucket.
3. User can edit the task and can select different bucket also in edit option.
4. User can mark task as complete and cannot edit the task in complete mode.
5. User can only edit if task is not marked as complete. User can mark task as remaining and complete it.
6. User can delete the task. Cannot delete the bucket(functionality not included).

Thank you.
